Simple AutoHotkey program which helps you do the Double Crouch Glitch.

I recommend setting the secondary hotkey for Crouch as G, as the program will always simulate G twice if you press K.

## How to preform
1. Set the secondary hotkey for CTRL (Crouch) to G.
2. Go to any level and hold CTRL (Crouch)
3. Spam K
4. Experience Hyperspeed
